# Exploring Spotify Data in SQL

## Overview

This project uses a variety of SQL queries to explore a database of Spotify tracks, artists, and genres. For ease of display in a Jupyter Notebook, this is done using SQLite and displaying the query results with pandas DataFrames. The database itself is very large and not included with this project, but it can be created from [this Spotify database project](https://github.com/tommcd09/spotify-database). The data comes from a [Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-600k-tracks?select=tracks.csv) containing about 600k tracks and 1 million artists from Spotify from 1921 to 2020. As of mid-2022, Spotify has over 82 million tracks [2], so this is by no means close to all the music on Spotify. However, it is enough to include a lot of great music from a wide range of time periods.
